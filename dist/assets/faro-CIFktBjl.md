# From Curiosity to Necessity: Adding Frontend Observability to a Personal Project 🚀

I’ve always been skeptical of marketing buzzwords, but sometimes technology proves you wrong. What started as a simple curiosity quickly became a genuine necessity. 

## A New Project, A New Question 🤔

A few days after launching my personal website, I showed it to a friend who was so impressed that she asked me to build a website for her bed and breakfast 🛌. The goal was to create a standalone platform to reduce her reliance on Booking.com.

While Booking.com is convenient, it comes at a cost around 20% of the gross daily rate 💸. It's like an invisible commission that you don't realise because it's not costing you money, instead it's shrinking your gross revenue. Our idea was to build a website that would allow users to:

*   📅 View room availability on a calendar.
*   💰 Get an automatic price quote.
*   ✍️ Send a booking request directly.

This approach would benefit both the business and the customer by eliminating middleman fees. After building the site, a new question emerged: **What if we could see where our users were coming from?** 🌍

Wouldn’t it be amazing to know their country, language, and how much time they spend on the site? These insights could help us personalize the user experience, optimise navigation and even offer custom deals. That’s when I dove into the world of frontend observability.

## Exploring the Options 🗺️

In previous roles, I had used **Real User Monitoring (RUM)** from Datadog. It’s a powerful solution but often overkill for a small project with a limited budget. I also considered Hotjar, which is excellent for heatmaps, but I wanted a more integrated, cost effective solution.

That’s when I discovered **Grafana Faro**, a free, open-source frontend observability solution within the Grafana Cloud ecosystem. It was love at first query ❤️

## Getting Started with Grafana Faro 🛠️

Setting up Grafana Faro is straightforward. In Grafana Cloud, a setup wizard walks you through the process:

1.  **Specify your domain and app name.**
2.  **Install the necessary dependencies.** For my React project 💻, I ran:

    ```bash
    npm install @grafana/faro-react @grafana/faro-web-tracing @grafana/faro-web-sdk
    ```

3.  **Configure the sampling rate.** This determines how much user session data you collect. For high-traffic sites, collecting 100% of sessions can be costly. However, for a small project like ours, sampling 100% is perfectly fine and provides maximum insight at no extra cost.

## Adding Faro to the React App 👨‍💻

Next, I located the entry point of my React application, `main.tsx`, and added the following code to initialize Faro:

```typescript
import { matchRoutes } from 'react-router-dom';
import {
  initializeFaro,
  createReactRouterV6DataOptions,
  ReactIntegration,
  getWebInstrumentations,
} from '@grafana/faro-react';
import { TracingInstrumentation } from '@grafana/faro-web-tracing';

initializeFaro({
  url: 'https://faro-collector-prod-eu-west-2.grafana.net/collect/xyz', // Replace with your collector URL
  app: {
    name: 'bnb',
    version: '1.0.0',
    environment: 'production',
  },
  instrumentations: [
    // Mandatory default instrumentations
    ...getWebInstrumentations(),

    // Capture HTTP request traces
    new TracingInstrumentation(),

    // React router integration
    new ReactIntegration({
      router: createReactRouterV6DataOptions({
        matchRoutes,
      }),
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Wrapping Up and Testing ✅

To complete the setup, I installed the Faro rollup plugin for the build process:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @grafana/faro-rollup-plugin
```

After rebuilding the project with `npm run build` 🚀 and deploying the changes, data started flowing into Grafana Cloud (it might take a few minutes). Just like that, we had a real time, OOTB dashboard with valuable user activity insights.

Within those dashboards, we can see the performance of the frontend through the web vitals metrics - a naming convention that Google created to measure key aspects of user experience on web pages, mainly 3 blocks: loading, interactivity and visual stability.

On top of that, you can observe the number of page loads, JS errors, sessions to follow the user flow and how they interact and now the HTTP requests and its RED metrics. This can be quite useful to identify the slowest requests and start troubleshooting from there.  

Additionally, since those signals collected in Faro are logs, you can create some cool visual panels running queries in LogQL format (like a PromQL but for logs) and fine tune them as you want 📈.

## Final Thoughts ✨

This experiment was a powerful reminder that data isn’t just for marketers but for everyone 💡. Understanding how users interact with your website is no longer a luxury; it’s a superpower that in the right hands can build some magic. And the best part is that you can achieve it with free, open-source tools and just a few lines of code.

If you’ve built something and want to understand your users better, give Grafana Faro a try. It might just change the way you see your website—and the web itself. 🌐
